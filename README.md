#Excel Lex Bot

Our institution hopes to make use of Amazon Lex in teaching, research and health care. However, most of them are non-technical users such as English Teachers and Therapist and we don’t developers to support them from the development to update their Chat Bot. Most of them can know how to Microsoft Excel well and we don’t think it is possible to teach them build Chat Bot in Amazon Lex Console, although it is already very user friendly for developers.
ExcelLexBot is a CloudFormation package that converts predefined format excel (xlsx) into Amazon Lex Chat Bot.
